# cyclistic-case-study

To complete the Capstone Course from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program,
I was tasked with selecting a case study to complete using the tools and knowledge I garnered from the program.

I first cleaned the data in BigQuery via a few SQL queries. The queries have been saved to this repository.

1_column_schema.txt : query I ran to confirm the column names matched between tables
2_select_distinct.txt: query used to confirm uniqe values for ride_id (ultimately led to decision to drop this column)
3_UNION_clauses.txt: query used to combine all bigquery tables into one data set
4_filter.txt : query used to filter docked_bikes from the final table results
